## What is DevOps?

### DevOps is the Union of Development and Operations

DevOps removes the barrier that classically existed between development teams and IT Operations, first, enabling work to flow from development into operations team fluidly and eventually to empowering developers to own a stake in the IT / Ops stream. Conversely it also enabled Ops engineers to adopt methodologies from development, and their their work as code.

### DevOps is a technology discipline

In a way, DevOps and similar concepts have become their own technology disciple, with tools and processes unique to them.

### DevOps is a way of thinking

You can apply DevOps or Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) to any number of systems. All you need is a validation pipeline and a deployment process that creates value.

### DevOps is a way of improving the Tech Value Stream

DevOps can be defined in multiple ways, but fundamentally it's a process that can be applied to a tech work stream in order to make it better. It's mission is to minimize bottlenecks, increase code deployment speed, help build-in quality, and automate everything! Using the tools of the trade we aspire to create a pipeline that pushes code changes to production as fast as possible while maintaining control of the quality and minimizing disruptions of service.
