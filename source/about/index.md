## About Me

Hi, my name is John Knight.
I have a lot of interests, technology being both the source of my livelihood and my main hobby.
I love traveling - especially internationally - and would like to fill a map with pins from all the places Iâ€™ve visited. So far I've visited over a dozen countries worldwide. I've lived abroad and speak fluent Spanish.

Other interests include cooking, reading (I read daily, fiction and non-fiction) and consuming media(Streaming,Gaming, Music, etc)

This page is in progress. More detail to follow.
